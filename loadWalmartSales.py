this is such a long time coming block angel we have been in different spaces
throughout the years but now we're in a very similar space of talking about trans issues from a really similar perspective and it's been so nice to
have someone else doing it and um you are legendary you're an icon you have paved
the way for the trans community in a lot of a sense um you started out in porn was that where you started yeah yeah i
did i started and and now you're speaking out on a more political level which is why i relate to you so much more now
um what is that transition for life and how has it been received
well you know doing porn is it's never going to be received well ever but even
though half the population watches porn i think over half it's the dirty little secret that no one
wants to talk about that being said i don't have any issues with my pornography i don't do pornography anymore i create sex toys
now but that being said it was difficult actually to sort of move into a space i'm in now
from porn and most if you notice there's not a lot of people who kind of move out of pornography for lack of a better word
mainstream it's a very difficult space but i think because i've always had my message has never changed you know i've
always really kept focused on what i want the world to see which is a person like me being just a person and not necessarily
an oddball or a weirdo or a freak but just you know and sexual i want people to see me as a sexual type person and i
think that's also important for our community because i think a lot of times our community gets um
de-sexualized on some level like yeah yeah 100 percent well with what's interesting because
the world will sexualize the hell out of us yes but then we're on these medications that desexualize us you know
what i mean you know we are medications that really take our sex drives and especially you know you talk about the trans kid thing which we'll get into
um you know they're on medications before they even develop so they never sometimes never even experience an
orgasm or anything ever ever can you imagine like pardon me but it's so bizarre to me that
we have this idea i think within our community there was a lot of time that people would say to me oh well you're
really fetishizing trans men and i thought to myself but hold up here wait a minute here first off there's nothing
wrong for me i don't believe that fetishizing is a bad thing i think it's just a form of sexualization and i don't
have a problem being sexualized at all it sort of helped me be this person and it helped me really
be comfortable in my weird body right in my different kind of body and so for me
the fetishization of my body was important for me to be able to walk the world naked and to be saying look i'm a
different kind of man i don't have what other men have and and i don't think it's a bad thing on some level it's also
just up to the individual person so some people um and it may be due to their own traumas throughout their lives or just
because of their personality or their own sense and and view of sex they're not comfortable being sexualized and
that's valid but then there are people that are like me
is so cool is that i've seen you now you've done a bunch of um
really right-wing shows recently that you know a lot of them that i've
done but i if you would have asked me if someone could like move from porn especially trans porn and to make those
shows i would have been like no they would never you know they might tolerate blair white but they're not going to go
for like the porn star but you're doing it you're killing it you're making a huge difference thank you and for all
the talk about representation in the community you know we need representation in in books and movies and
we also need it in the right-wing space that's right and you're being and you're a big part of that and you know that's
so important regardless of what people have to say about it but well you know i people have said all kinds of things about me my whole life so it's like i
grew a thick skin and i don't really care what anybody thinks about me what i care about is making change in the world
whether or not you like me or not oh you know i always say it it's just respect respect man i'll respect you back those
right wing people whatever you want to call them respect me my own community doesn't respect me so ask me where i'm
gonna go i'm gonna go there they're the ones who give me space to have these conversations they're the ones who are willing to have the conversation
i always walk away shaking hands and actually i'm friends with people so there's something
something there that i want people to understand just because you are something doesn't make you part of that
community and just because i'm a transsexual man doesn't mean i have to go along with everything that's being
said in the trans community because i disagree with probably more than 80 percent of the stuff that's coming out of there i mean likewise i mean sounds a
little redundant to even say but same for me you know like it's um there's a list of things we have to say
that's right as trans people there's a list of positions we must take to be considered part of the community that's
right which i go back and forth between even considering myself part of the community i have trans friends you're one of them i love my trans friends
um and a lot of my supporters are trans but am i really part of the trans community i don't know based on the way
they treat me that's right is that really a community i want to be a part of and what's so crazy is you mentioned like um
that um a lot of these like right-wing shows and the people behind them have embraced you and considered you a friend and worked with you and it's interesting
because one of the things i'm sure you get it as well is i get people saying well you know blair they don't really respect you those aren't really your
friends but first of all people don't know who my friends are i have like five real friends so you're right just because i was on
someone's show does not mean i'm their friend right um but it's interesting because
they never name the people that don't respect me they'll never actually name names so just say in general you know writing people and it's like i'm under
no illusion the right wing is like the savior of trans people or allies of trans people
what i'm doing is purposely trying to build a bridge between the two because there is and you're doing it as well and
i'm so thankful there's no the the way trans politics right now is going
this is the titanic this is the iceberg that's right and i feel like you and i are like
desperately trying to turn the wheel off just me and you i know but i also wanted to talk to you about
this and we'll get into detail of all the things that we disagree with the community on but um
one of the things that's so frustrating about being me is knowing well there's a lot of things one of the
things that comes to mind right now is how many trans people that are famous
that are in my dms saying i agree with you oh my god you're so right about trans kids this is am smr right now um
yes you're so right about a transport you're so right about trans kids and these are yes huge figures with
audiences even bigger than mine even bigger than yours and and they're perpetuating these things but they are
different behind closed doors so i feel like often i'm in a community full of
cowards let's be real hypocrites cowards and the only reason why things that we believe are even seen as radical yep
is because the sheer lack of people who will talk about it that's right if there was even a few more people just one well kaitlyn
as well now well caitlyn has she's stepped up yeah she has she and she's taking all the slings and arrows ooh
she's taking heat but she doesn't care that's why she's so who she is and i support her like i'm not going to be i'm
not on everything that she says politically but that's okay it doesn't matter that doesn't mean that what she
isn't doing is putting herself in a space in the world to see a trans woman on fox news right yet these people
continually say well we need representation so the minute there's representation it's the wrong kind of representation this is how wing nutty
our community has become i don't belong to that community either just so you know that's not my community my community is people who care my
community is humans my community is gay people straight people whatever black white you're an individual that's right
i don't there's no reason because i'm a transsexual person that i have to belong to a a space that i feel has become on some
level culti and indoctrinating and i don't believe in any way shape or form that that is community i believe it's a
forceful way to get people to believe something so because there's power in numbers you know the more people you get
involved in a cause that more more powerful that cause becomes and
to me i just question like what does me having what does me being trans have to
do with 12 year olds being trans sterilizing themselves right being in sports
in women's leagues none of that like when i was sitting and i was like oh my god i think i'm trans years ago and coming to terms with who i
am and transitioning none of that was part of it that's right so the idea that i'm supposed to be on
board with it is ridiculous especially when it defies logic it defies science it defies ethics
it defies so much of like i feel like a lot of people in the community first of all
are not trans right period there's been a huge influx
of straight people that's right cis people that come in and they have other issues that they are
misdiagnosing as trans and these are typically the people that lead us down the path of
things that make us look well because now you don't need gender dysphoria to be trans i mean that's an actual thing they say and i'm like really then why
are you even trans well trans is blah blah blah you know they come up with all this insane i mean but why do you want
to be trans so bad this is not beautiful i always pushed against that hashtag trans is beautiful i thought you are
actually indoctrinating people with that it is not beautiful it's a life full of medicine it's a life full of surgery
it's a life full of always having to be honest about who you are and when you start saying biology isn't part of that
you are actually not trans then trans is biology 100
that that's why also you have the right wingers that come and talk about what about biology it's like yeah that's that
was a huge part of it actually yeah for me and it's not for a lot of these other people that are in the community now but
for me it had everything to do with it i would have never had the desire to transition or have these
feelings if there was not something that went wrong in my wiring as a child possibly even as a fetus because there's
been studies that show that as well um and and you're right that now you know activists have really pushed this
idea of dysphoria not being a part of the equation at all they you know and i hate things that were dangerous because that's been you
know weaponized danger all these weird words that they throw out there but it is it is actually applies to that when
you start opening up the door to say anyone can be trans that says to me wait a minute there's some kind of thing
going on here there's some form i'm gonna do i sound conspiracy okay i might be but that being said there has to be
something bigger why do you want all these young people to be trans and why are we putting this in a space where
it's like anyone can just self-idea as trans and then you don't look like a female or you don't look like a male and
you have no desire to want to be like that i have a desire to walk the world as a man and to look like a man and you
don't think everyone should know how much work it takes for me and you to look this way it's not natural we have
to work our ass off pain pain everything but we do it so what about this new generation that doesn't
want to what they call pass right and me and you have passing privilege we don't have passing privilege we have a thing
that's called determination and our determination put us here because we want to look like men and women so
that's where i distinguish myself as a different type of person than these people that are today self iding not
wanting to pass no surgery no hormones gender whatever they are i don't even
know but that's why i really do make an effort to say i'm a transsexual man i am not transgender i try really hard to say
transsexual and you watch my videos i think you know that i don't always say it no but i try
but it's hard because i also grew up in a generation where that wasn't the worst that's right so that's like the struggle is that through the generations the
concept has changed but you're right transsexual is so much more of an appropriate and objectively accurate
term because it is that it's medical it's medical which is
i'm a medicalized person who has gender dysphoria i've been diagnosed with it i have a disorder i have all of the things
that i know made me this person and because of that i went through steps it took a long time i did not rush through
this and it's really what i advocate for slow down why is everybody in such a hurry to transition that's where my red
you know my my red flag goes up and i'm like wait a minute people are rushing into this life changing space this is not i'm
going to paint my eyebrows green and then tomorrow i'm going to change them to blue i'll tell you why they're rushing
there's a lot of money to be made off these kids having these surgeries and going on this medication so the doctors
are rushing them the parents are being emotionally blackmailed saying telling them that you know their kid's going to
kill themselves that they don't and what people have to understand we talked about this in the video we just filmed for my channel which is already out um
that when you tell the parents that kids who don't transition kill themselves that's right you're also
telling the kid that oh god you are putting that in their head that they're either transitioning or their life is
over and they'll never be happy when in reality i hear from people every single day
who are grown ass men and women biological you know cis people who are comfortable being that and say i grew up
with dysphoria i grew up thinking that there was something different about me i have so much parallels in your story but
thank god i was able to outgrow it yep move on from it but now they're not giving kids that option but
they're not that's exactly i put on my twitter i i wrote to all the women out there who
were raised as tomboys or masculine women how what do you how i forgot how i exactly put it but i said how are you
now living your life as a woman and or would you have been fast-tracked as a trans kid oh my god it went viral it
blew up i got thousands upon thousands of women telling me my god buck i would
have been totally fast-tracked as a trans person because i was masculine i was this i was a tomboy i was and i
thought wow this is so powerful this is what kids need to see yeah that's why i did it because i want young people to
see you can be a masculine girl or a feminine boy that has nothing to do with being trans yet the concept of a tomboy
has been erased that's right which is gone so so sickening it's sickening i
think butch women are so important but especially gay butch women okay not all
butch women are gay but gay butch women we've lost that space and i remember when i transitioned 30 years ago cake
imagine i was in the gay woman's community i was very butch and i'll never forget when i wanted to transition
they hated me they came after me they called me a traitor i lost all my friends i had no friends when i
transitioned i did it all by myself and it was a very lonely weird space to be in and so as you see today kids have
tick tock they have instagram they have all these things where they can sort of be a community which actually on some
level is dangerous because i think that they feed each other i didn't have any of that and i did it all by myself and i
think because of that it really made me think about what i was doing and how how this is going to affect the wrestlers
you had to stand on your own that's right and that's the thing that so many people ask me like how can you
be right wing and trans and it's like honestly you can't i think that being trans actually made me right yes because
it instilled in me the importance of self-reliance that's right independence uh financial security and making it was
not cheap to transition so i had to like buckle up and be like oh my god i have
to rely on me and myself only that's right and that's how those virtues of self-reliance independence and
individualism were instilled in me so honestly people who think it's so confusing i think there's nothing because trans made me
right-wing i'm gonna be honest but do you know how many lgbt people are right there's so many people just don't know
it and actually they don't talk about it because they get nailed by the community yeah if they talk about well i'm not really you know a democrat or i'm not on
the left i'm more i'm more in the middle to be honest with you but that being said i see myself going my dad's just
waiting he's like i'm going to make you republican that's great we're going to work together
but but but it's true you know like um tell me your experience as well but for me i can't walk through a gay club
through a trans night at a club i can't walk through an lgbt area without being stopped constantly from gay people trans
people everything in between saying i agree with you but i could never say it's like well you know what yep
maybe some of y'all need to start saying it that's right stand up is it just like if you have the balls
if you have the balls to cut off your balls you have the ball to say what you mean brilliant just say what the
you mean but why is everybody so goddamn scared and because they see what we get they see
the abuse we get from the community i don't care about it no yeah we're good over here you can join us you're not gonna and
every person that joins us is gonna be less slings and arrows for them that's right that's right so and i've noticed
that myself yeah like when i was one of the only ones it was like damn i'm getting a lot of hate over here oh yeah you came in
it's divided in two that's right that's right now it took a little bit of your crap
and you know what when a third person you miss caitlyn and then so
it's it's crazy because there are ethics to be considered with with being trans now that people just
throw out the window so you have these kids making irreversible decisions um and then you know the transport thing is
a little bit less of i think a pressing issue although it's it's still something that needs to be talked about of course it needs to be talked about so what's
your views on like leah thomas oh my god she she needs to step back step back and
step down no delaying and she needs to give that trophy to the woman who she beat in that thing and that would have
been so powerful if she did that it would have been so oh my god i would love her if she did that i haven't even
considered that could have been something it would have been so huge for us for our community that's right it would have literally i
was a i was a female a very high ranking female athlete i know what it takes to get to that level and it's not a joke
and so for some trans woman to come in and pretend as if she doesn't have an advantage and leah knows she has an
advantage let's just be honest here yeah she's just being used first when you have to look down
at all your competition you're noticing an advent you know it and when your shoulders are literally
twice the size your hand your arm reach everything everything everything come on lady man it's it's like reading what's
that lady man but you know what i mean i'll respect her pronouns and i'll do all of that i
have no issues with that that being said i have issues with cheating especially in sports and we're not being honest
about biology now with kids totally different my son plays with girls on soccer team it's all good no one cares
those are kids no one cares high school is getting a little bit different i think yeah and i think we do need to
have a little bit of a discussion about that but forget it when it comes to college or pro sport no no no no sorry
dude you are a trans woman which makes you a biological male get with the program and i'm not into it i will i'm
not okay with it and she was on hormones for one year for like four years
started as an adult yeah and it was all and as someone who i think we might have been actually close to the same age when
we started hormones and i can confirm that that first year it's not as if like there were changes but
they're not that dramatic in the first year they sure aren't sometimes not even in the second that's right third you
know i'm still noticing changes six years seven years after that i'm like oh wow that's different and i didn't think
that would ever change but it did cool um so the the idea that like
the other thing is people who don't go on hormones have no idea what hormones really do none they have no idea that's
right what they can and can't do they think that you take a pill and all of a sudden it's equal and it's like
i'm sorry no no far from it and i'm on testosterone i can tell you that it has
literally changed everything in my life i'm still changing from it 30 years on this stuff wow so these hormones are
powerful and at the same time we need to understand what's happening with these bodies if you've already gone through so
so now when i say when you've gone through purity that's when people are gonna say well see that's why puberty blockers are so important but no don't
see why people developers we need to understand that trans people are different than biological people i'm a
different type of man and when you try to put me in with all men you're actually being disrespectful to me as a
transsexual man i'm not a biological man i never will be i'm a different kind of man and i respect that and because i
respect it guess what dudes respect me and there's beauty in acknowledging
those differences like right i i said this on i did an event over the weekend where the moderator was um a cis woman
and a lot of the questions i felt like were leading me to almost like well blair how does it feel to be whatever
and i was like it puts no sadness dysphoria or
hate in my heart to acknowledge that i'm different from this woman sitting next to me that's right in fact i think it makes you more
beautiful it does it makes you more powerful more beautiful and understanding who you are so so even
like let's just use the analogy of a person of color so i think that they
want to be proud of being a person of color they're not going to walk in and stand in a room of white people and be like okay well i guess right now i
should just be white no you should be black and you should be cool with being black what if everyone just started calling you a white woman
you'd be pissed about that because you're not a white woman you're a black woman so on some level it's kind of a similar thing why are we trying to
disassociate our trans right our trans history by making us say trans women or
women trans women are not women trans women are trans women yes you love god and why is that not enough why is that
not enough that's what's so bizarre to me it's such a mantra it's such a culty mantra and it doesn't do trans people
any good because for me to go to a doctor's appointment it's important for me to state these are
the medications i'm on because i am trans this is the difference on how you're going to have to care for me medically
as a person different from a different woman you know you i walk in and i have doctors asking me are you pregnant or
breastfeeding right now right and it's like if i was one of these people who think trans women are women i would just
say i would just say no but for me it's like that's an opportunity for me to say no because i
am trans and the way they're going to care for you is completely different because there's so much more to take you know yes people don't understand also
like before i say this can we get water in here it's really hot
it's so hot like i'm sweating i thought i was a sweaty pig i'm like
always sweating it's testosterone maybe i still got something i'm
dying i don't want to forget i was gonna but when we get back i was gonna say um talk about the
which that's a whole other story thank you so much sander oh right on my friend thank you
we are dying in here okay
um oh yeah so one of the things that i think people
don't talk enough about and especially doctors don't talk about this you know when i went to get on hormones i walked
in and 20 minutes later had a prescription for estrogen and there was no safeguards no anything they don't
tell you about the negative trade-offs that you will likely experience by being on those medications
every medication has a side effect right that's right so for trans women you know osteoporosis is a thing
um that's something that i'm gonna have to really um combat through certain foods and maybe other drugs long term um
and then honestly i'm not super educated on all the negative effects because they are hidden from you they don't think about it that's right so that's right
for trans men what are the things that you've had to deal with negatively as side effects from testosterone excellent
question and um so i want to say before i say that i just want to say so i thought we had a thing called informed
consent right yeah where's the information to make to make a a an actual real
choice with in you're not giving the right information so how can even a youngster make an informed choice if
they're not being informed properly or even parents right so that's they're being duped right off that the bat
one thing i know that young trans men are not being told is uh atrophy can happen from long-term use
of testosterone and what atrophy is is it's it deals with your reproductive system right so me being a biological
female i have a reproductive system a uterus and a cervix and a vagina and all these things once you start putting in
estrogen into my body i mean testosterone into my body it takes out the estrogen which is basically what
happens for menopause right women start losing their their estrogen and age and then your vaginal space becomes like
total mess and long story short is i had no estrogen and no one knew because i'm an experiment 30 years ago they had no
idea what they were doing and i had all this pain and i'd go to gynecologists and they'd be like we don't really know what's going on
just go home and like deal with it until eventually i had what's called sepsis and what happened was i had an
infection that popped inside of me and i became septic which people don't understand septic means you're gonna die
because it got into my bloodstream and if i wouldn't have got to the hospital fast enough they said dude five more minutes you would be dead oh my god yeah
no kidding i'm sitting here alive today because the doctors could actually figure out what was wrong with me long
story short i was one of the very first long-term females on testosterone with this and i have the first recorded case
of atrophy due to long-term use of testosterone that's just one thing that can happen to us but they're not telling
these young guys who are taking this and then they're all saying well i'm getting these weird cramps and i have this thing
and i'm just like you have atrophy dude and the doctors don't even know any of that so i'm just thinking to myself like
how can we be giving all this medication to these young people without giving them the right information to make the
right choice because politics have completely embedded itself
in trans healthcare that's right it is so entirely political therapists doctors
endocrinologists are all in fear of losing their job their reputation their status and their credibility for having
the balls i'm really not trying to surprise here having the balls to tell someone actually maybe you shouldn't be
on these medications but they can't affirmative therapy now and what's that's not even therapy therapy is when
you sit with your therapist and she says well hold up wait a minute dude how do you know you're trans and why do you want to be trans and they push back on
you which never happens for me by the way so it was a roll of the dice wow that i was happy with transitioning
that's right it was very much a roll of the dice and you're looking at really three generations of trans people right now
pretend there's a 13 year old in the room that's right you're looking at you where you had safeguards you had to live as a man for a year before you died
that's right for me flash forward 20 years later yep no safeguards it's not one wow not one
therapist appointment i i did go to a therapist um on my own accord beforehand to figure out if it was something else
but they're not a gender therapist it was not the same thing right um and then these kids have even less
safeguards than me none zero they have zero safety that's what people do not understand so people who defend this
will make the argument well if a health professional decides it's the right thing for you to say it's like first of all
have we not learned in the past two years a lot of health professionals don't really know what the they're talking about and we won't even talk about all the things that make us
believe that now but the trans kid thing is just so
to me and and we talked about all this like five minutes ago in a video we're kind of but we need to keep talking about it
because i don't care that's fine people will hear that but the more we start speaking about it and they understand not all trans people are okay with
transitioning children that then more trans people are going to start i'm already getting more trans guys stepping up behind me they are they're trying to
say thank you buck you're giving me the balls they say that to me to stand up and start speaking about this and i'm like look you guys you're not going to
lose anything the community is not your community nobody cares about you unless you're
saying the things that they want you to say that's not community so it doesn't matter what you say right
now and if are you more concerned with what people think about you are you more concerned with your integrity integrity
is what will get you through the world not this dumb community that's happening right now people hate you because you're speaking out about things that need to
be spoken out about and that's the trans aside that's right that's your integrity as a human being that's right
if you can sit by and you really ignore the fact that 12 year olds are
getting double mastectomies wow that that 12 year olds are going on puberty blockers not developing they're
destroying their healthy reproductive systems if you can sit by and say well that's collateral damage or well i'm going to
stay in my lane or whatever um that's right your lane should be sticking up for what's right and i understand not
everyone's going to be as outspoken as that's because they don't have to be maybe you're maybe you're a high school coach maybe you're a doctor maybe you're
a teacher maybe you work it talk about i don't know it's not the same thing however if you're in this community and you're
talking about trans issues and you're not talking about the human rights violations that are
occurring against kids right now and i will call it that because i believe that it is you're complicit that's right you're
excellent not even not only people like to say part of the problem you know you're perpetuating the problem that's right and and it's not and
there's going to be a huge pendulum effect that's really good i i don't want to believe this could ever happen but i could foresee a future
where transitioning as adults become somehow illegal because people eventually are going to have to push back on this and the way humans work is
it always goes that's right right so when they really start pushing back against the trans kid thing i would not
be surprised if there's a few states at least they're like actually transitioning in general is illegal and then look now we're completely
that's what i keep saying i keep saying you guys are going to ruin it for all of us right once you put kids in the
picture we're done people don't play with kids that's why it's weird to me that we put
kids in the front of this whole sort of place that trans is about we put kids in this front space because i think they
thought people would go oh these pork no that's when people started pushing back on us even harder because they're like
wait a minute you weirdo yeah wait you're um you're like doing what to kids cutting up kids yeah like uh that's
what they say just read it all on the right that's all what they say that we're cutting up kids that we're killing them that we're freaking them that we're
making them into freaks that we're making them were desexualized they say awk and then are they no they're not that's the thing that's
right that's the thing it's like people want to be like how can you um you know sit there and listen to right people
talk about this i'm like are they wrong that's right the minute someone says that i don't have a right to live my life as an adult
how i choose you're my enemy as well but right-wingers who are speaking out against kids becoming sterile are
absolutely correct to do so that's right and you are not a normal you are not a healthy functioning human being your
brain's not working properly if you can look at what's happening and think that this is not a problem that's right because people are too fearful you see
what they're they're very smart whoever started this this trans activism they put fear in everybody in this community
fear if you say something you're transphobic you're a turf i'm all of those things i'm a hundred percent under
turf totally i'm a complete turf and i have no issues with that i do think we need to have the discussion about trans
women and women's spaces and understand if you're not you are not born a biological woman right you were raised
as a male yes which is a different space i was actually raised in a female not to say that you're not a woman or any of
that you understand where i'm going 100 socialization is everything and i understand i'm talking about that it is
so important for women to have i don't care about men men the whole world is a man space women biological women need to
have their own space and if the if they want to graciously let trans women come into space that's up to them it's not up
to us in the world to do that unless you are an actual biological woman and understand that space you don't get to
have a conversation in that but trans women are men they are biological men who come from a male space once they
start to you have such grace in the way you handle the women thing you understand it you understand who you are
you're very respectful to women that's why women are respectful to you because you don't want to override them because
they're a two-way street that's right but the people don't understand it doesn't go one way or it doesn't go the other way it goes we're going to meet
right here and i've been saying you know i was thinking about this the other day i was thinking maybe if you're going to become
a woman maybe start with learning to respect that that's right because what i'm seeing a lot of is these videos
there was this disgusting video recently maybe i'll put it in the edit of this um trans woman
loosely losing that term um in a bathroom saying you know basically filming and saying
i'm in the women's room and then and then did the deepest the most disgusting cynical or sinister laugh yes that i've
ever heard in my life and i'm like how can you and i'm supposed to i'm supposed to think those people are the trans allies
and those are the ones that are really fighting for the progress and it's like actually you're a piece of those are the ones that are ruining it if you
take pride in making women feel uncomfortable that's disgusting and people say okay where's the line it's not that hard i'll tell you where the
line is that's right i'll tell you where the line is i have a dick i'm not going in any space that's
right where that is visible that's right two women around me that's right because i would never want to disrespect them
that's what i'm saying this is the same thing as i don't i don't want your anything around me either that's right it's and it's
the same way i said it's a two-way street because it's also partly about me why would i want it out in front of anyone that's embarrassing for me i don't particularly love that part of me
it's part of being trans yes but then also you have to know your lane like my life is not missing out because
i'm not in women's changing rooms i live a beautiful vibrant life
and if there's one or two things that i don't feel comfortable doing and people don't feel comfortable with me doing because i'm trans yep
i can live with that that's right i'm not my life is not made or broken that's right by being able to have my dick in
front of women that see that's why people need to hear your voice out there and see trans women aren't all crazy
they're not all trying to take space they actually respect women you you literally use the woman's room no one's
gonna say anything dude no one's gonna look at you no one's gonna say anything to you why aren't
trans men right we don't see it the same flipped right that's right we don't see trans men
being rude about it that's right pushing their way into spaces granted it it's different in the sense that i don't
think a lot of biological men would be they don't care as uncomfortable because what people don't understand is that being a woman
there is a certain vulnerability that goes a long time right women are more vulnerable to a lot of things to sexual
harassment sexual violence yeah being made to feel uncomfortable yes and that's also part of it that i don't
understand why some trans women don't understand because that's one of the first things i actually learned when i transitioned
that i was like oh walking through the world being perceived as a woman
you there's a lot that is invited with that that's right there's a lot of the ways that men treat women that really are not cool you know i i lived
in hollywood for years and if you ever wanted i used to think i used to think cat calling wasn't a thing i used to be
one of those people that was like oh women are making such a big deal no you live in hollywood or new york or whatever and you understand what it is
to be catcalled i've been followed by men on the street i've had men there was one time a man pulled over next to me in
his car asked me for his number i said no thank you i'm engaged he followed me in his car was like speeding around me
like getting in front of me in the lane like it was crazy there's been so many situations that
once you actually do make that transition and you are perceived as a woman you understand that's right so so
it's not hard for me them to make that leap that well of course a lot of biological women would not feel comfortable because
they go through their whole lives having males pushing themselves on them yes and you know we can talk about if they're
right or wrong but they're perceiving this trans thing as the same thing yes they're at least very similar because the ones you just spoke about those
trans women who are not respecting uh women's spaces and go in and go i'm gonna show you my lady dick and like
really wow you think the whole world is going to be okay with that no you're the ones who aren't making it so the world
hates all of us why don't you just step over here there's no it is it's just not an argument like it's just not women's
only spaces are women's only spaces get over yourself right either you're going to be invited i'd do the same with men's
spaces in the beginning i was not invited to men's spaces they did not want me there they hated me in the early beginning when i didn't look so male
right and i was kind of on that sort of what are you kind of space and they hated it they were like leave get out of here this is a man's space and it would
hurt my feelings and i would leave but i would just keep coming back until eventually they were like okay you're cool you're but i never pushed myself on
it i always left the space and i always was very respectful of the space until eventually i just you know grew into
this space and they were okay but i just think that's a different conversation because men are different than very different it's they don't feel
threatened by me they're not threatened by me because they're not they're just not threatened by me and women are threatened by men by exactly
what you said so trans women would understand this particular little thing they might start to understand why
we argue about sports why women argue about their own space why women argue about being a lesbian and what that even
means right all of that is very very important and when you start putting trans women in prisons and now people
are getting pregnant in prisons who could have guessed that oh my god i'm just like you watched this thing happen
right and what's so frustrating about that is that you know and and you can probably it's
like we talk about these things we're like watch out soon we're going to be trans women and women's prisons they're going to be getting raped they're going
to be getting pregnant even if it's not rape you can't just have people having sex making babies that's right now you have anymore and you know it's it's
comical in a sense but it's also there are multiple that recent case i forget what state it was but there was um a trans woman who
impregnated a woman and like people were joking about it it's whatever i understand the comical sense
to it but also there are multiple children now that are being born into this world where both their parents are
in the prison prison system and guess where those kids go and the foster care is right and guess where their pipelines
do that's right there you go so it's like you know there's so much to be considered with
just the integration of trans people into society and i don't understand why so many trans people treat it as if it's
this combative thing rather than finding the areas where we can be cohesive and just well that's what we used to do we
used to do that i mean you did that i did that i was on the at the tail end of when they did that yes that's what thank
god though at least you got some of it because i'm telling you it's the reason why i'm a different kind of trans person because i literally had to actually have
myself co-exist in the world i had to learn how to do that i had to be part of the world not against the world where
today we're teaching young trans activists to be against the world unless the world just literally lays down and
lets us walk all over them that's never going to happen and it's so unhealthy it's like you're setting up you know
these kids to have this like adversarial relationship with the world and people around them and it doesn't
help anyone it creates more strife and i don't see this this trans thing going in any direction other than
more strife until it reaches just a complete boil which it feels like it is it already has it's it's now happening
yeah it's spilling over it's actually sad because so many people are gonna get so hurt from that including us on some level they're going to start taking away
our medication it's not going to be as easy of us to transition it's there's just going to be so many actual trans
people are going to get hurt from this they already are you what do you think about all those d transistors 28 000 d
transitioners in a group i don't know if they're all d trans but they must be interested in what's going on here but
those kids who should have never transitioned took away surgeries took away medication took away therapy from
an actual real trans person and that myself that in on some level is
so insane that now these kids now there's real trans people here suffering with their dysphoria and their chest and
all the things that they should have got they should have been put in front of the line there's like a five-year waiting line in in in uk at the nhs it
just exploded it exploded like how can it be a five year waiting to get trans surgeries this is ridiculous
yeah and and it's like it's hard because there is this
attitude and there will be some of this in the comments and there'll be some people tweeting about this after we post this and other stuff we filmed together
together earlier today people saying well why are they fighting against trans
the people and that is such a matter of perspective that's right that's right because in my
perspective you can't make me believe my intentions are different than what i know in my heart that's right which is my only
intention by talking about all of this is to actually help transfer that's right i'm trying to steer things in a
direction that i know is the correct direction that's right the correct direction is not 12 year
olds sterilizing themselves that's right the correct direction is not leah thomas in in women's sports that's right the
correct direction is not you're transphobic you don't want to me that's right correct you have bad taste
but you're not transported um you know like all this crazy crazy so why would we be on board with
that we're not going to be on board with that transition saved our lives so we are clearly all about transitioning
there is no way shape or form that we're anti any of that what we are is being logical and seeing something that's
happening that is not real and not trans and you know before you couldn't say you're not really trans but i'm going to
say it right here there are a lot of people who are not really trans who should not even be thinking about
transitioning and i would never say that if i didn't see the amount of d transitioners happening the amount of
kids saying i didn't get this i didn't get that i went into planned parenthood and 40 minutes later i had you know
testosterone and no one told me i was going to get all these things i'm thinking this is the most sloppiest
insane thing i've ever seen in my whole life and i want to not be a part of it i will not sloppy and it saved our lives
so the thing is people that's what people need to see we're not anti-trans that's ridiculous what we are is
anti-indoctrination anti-lies because there's a lot of lies coming up when you start saying biology
isn't real i'm done i'm out of here because that's the whole reason i'm a trans person is because of my biology
and all you have to look at is how much the conversation has changed in the past few years it's like that's how you know
no one knows what the they're doing because trans literally had a different definition four years ago that's right
non-binary the term non-binary if you if you look it up on google you look at um you can look up certain phrases and
words to see the um amount they've been used over the years over time and non-binary was literally
not used searched for googled or typed on the internet before like 2014. at
least not in the gender sense i mean it has other things maybe like coding whatever and you see like genderqueer
and all kinds of other like things right it's like it's like but that's the other frustrating thing is this is this push
to make um non-binary like under the trans umbrella
i don't think trans should be a umbrella it's not an umbrella i think it should be a very specific diagnosis it's
why i moved from transgender to transsexual once they started saying that transgender is an umbrella term i'm
like i'm not an umbrella term that's total nonsense and i have a very specific thing yeah from you know i want
a born female and i want to be a male it's real easy people there's no you know but that kind of stuff mixes people
up and they don't understand i really think of non-binary as a holding pattern and i think a lot of kids take on this
non-binary either decide to transition or say oh this is the wrong space for me to go but i think that they want to be a
part of something so non-binary is a way for them to be a part of what's happening of course it's a group they
think they're joining and the other the the other thing that needs to be discussed is the fact that there's a lot
of people particularly young people that have never had a real struggle in their life that's right that's exactly right
they've never had a real struggle in their life they've never had any characteristic that defines them out of
just being a normal white kid in the suburbs they hate it right and i would hate it
too and i grew up a normal white kid in the suburbs and i hated it but i didn't leap onto some sort of
identity to just change it i happened to actually be trans and figured it out but i'm seeing a lot of people that just
they just want some sort of struggle that they want some sort of group you know and and i get that but maybe like
join like a spinning class or something like or the goth or punk rock or something that's so that's this is the
new gotham punk it's the new gotham punk rock just cutting off their boobs except oh my god someone wrote something the
other day that it was so profound it was like saying that actually the new trans stuff is more about mod body
modification it's like a body mod space you know like remember when piercing and tattooing and was like this big deal now
it's about body mod about your chest and about you know your body and about and i was like whoa that's like really
profound it's true i haven't really thought about it yeah what comes to mind when you say that is um a lot of people that are
getting double mastectomies and they're also opting to remove their nipples uh i can't even handle it so to me okay
you're not trying to be a man then you're trying to be something else something else because men have nipples that's right that's
right that's different that's where i started asking these kids what are you doing they're like oh buck you're so old this is like the new way of doing things
i said wait a minute here it is not the new way of doing anything what you're doing is you're desexualizing yourself
well the doctors told us that we don't need our nipples i said you 100 need your nipples nipples are in a erogenous
zone they're like a thing they actually feel i feel my nipples what are you talking about and so that in itself the
fact that doctors are even telling these young people oh you don't need your nipples it's totally okay i'm like what
what what are we we're gonna have a group of kids that are gonna grow up with no chest and no nipples and can we speak really
real about something really quick i don't know if this is your experience but a lot of these trans doctors are
weird oh god they're insane or first off doctors are a little bit insane they're very egotistical they're narcissists
actually yeah yeah they are they are remember doctors practice medicine this is what people don't understand they
don't know medicine they're practicing medicine so they don't know anything so a lot of times they use us as a way and
means to figure out this drug or they don't necessarily know what they think about it sometimes a doctor will give you a drug and and if it doesn't work
you have to go back and they give you a different kind of drug yeah so they don't necessarily know but i think a ton of these trans doctors are
complete wingnut weirdo like nazi like you know experimenting on kids kind of
100 yeah and and even the ones that are um that i've gone to throughout the
years i've found that a lot of them just are a little
it's weird because we're if if we weren't on camera i'd be saying in a much more free way
i'll just say i would say it to you if there was no cameras a lot of them are weirdos a lot of them are chasers no that's true too hundred
percent i i've i've had doctors throughout the years that ended up just being chasers yep that's exactly um and
that's a whole other conversation um and a lot of them get very they become activists rather than doctors
that's right they're so overly invested in the space that they make calls that
are not necessarily logical or best for the the the patients that's right 100
that doctor i think i talked about earlier that's i think his name is jack turbin he works at stanford he's a huge
pusher of puberty blockers and he's not an actual doctor he's like an intern doctor or something like that but he's
really in in bed with lupron and so that's the other thing we need to understand these doctors get in bed with
these big pharma people yeah and that's why this is happening i believe it's all about the money lupron the drug that has
been used throughout history to sterilize pedophiles that's right that's what we're giving now we're using it for children now we're using it for kids and
they love to blanket it and really nice um phrases like like affirmative care
trans health care yeah that's right trans affirming care we're gonna have so many screwed up kids in this world and
like no way i'm fighting we're fighting for the kids you know what somebody's got to save these kids somebody has to
step up and say something in our community so i really appreciate that you have for lack of a better experience
than the balls to speak up about this because it is a difficult thing you know the communities is so insane right now
and it's so one it's focused in this one specific way that anyone who speaks ill of anything
outside of what they tell you to speak is a transphobe it's a turf that's culty it's very good look it up anyone out
there look it up look what a cult is made and you will see check marks you can check mark everything in the trans community there is a lot of cult like
practices in the trans community wow a lot wow have you lost a lot of friends
this is how i look at i'm a 60 year old dude you think i'm you think i'm stupid i'm not i've been through hell
and back and if my friend doesn't like me because i have a different opinion go for it dude out of here get out of my
life because my friends have different opinions the people who are in my life the small amount of people who are in my
life have different opinions than me that's why they're my friends right because it's how we learn and how we
socialize and how we kind of get things to change you can't just be around people who think like you that's not
cool you have to have people have different opinions and talk about things and do all that so my friends in the
community were never my friends and i just realized that 100 so i don't really care you don't have to be my friend i'm
not here to be your friend i'm here to create change and i'm here for the kids now that's my i don't like i said
earlier i don't care about an adult who makes a choice yeah i care about a 12 year old being duped in the fact that
they're trans and that they need to have top surgery yeah what and we know what's so scary is that
um people often talk about like oh in a few years there's going to be just so many de-transitions because all this and that's true but there's already so many
so many and this has only become so radical in the past few years so it's it's going to take some people like
that's right a lot of time to figure out that they've been that's right violated that's right and so it's going to be
just this huge it breaks my heart honestly because this saved my life and i'll keep saying it
over and over it has been the best thing i ever did i would not be sitting here today i would not be alive i would not be functioning i wouldn't be the badass
that i think i am i wouldn't be any of that stuff if i didn't transition and that's what i want people to see they
need to see that it can save someone's life and they can become a great part of this this earth but we are not doing that
right now we're doing something else to these children these children others are trans this is some other it is
not are we are we trying to so so one of the things i think a lot of people say is that it's homophobic that people are
transitioning their children because they'd rather have a son than a gay daughter that's also well let's let's be
real because be real you look at um other countries particularly the middle east that's right uh where
basically to cure being gay you transition because they figure if you're going to be having men then you might as
well just be a woman and that's what they do to cure gay people in these middle eastern countries and when we see
that we say oh that that's homophobia yep that's disgusting when it happens here from some like white liberal mother
right on my friend white yeah i love you so much i say it all the time
it's always white they're all white not one black trans guy comes after me not one black people don't play that no they
don't have other to deal with are you kidding me yeah this is this is almost exclusively it's exclusive
kids it's like it's like a white white kid that's right like 100
why is it that's a great question and so i personally think it's because they don't they they are in a space to be
able to do that they don't have any worries in the world they got everything pretty much handled there right so they need a struggle which is what you said
earlier they need some kind of struggle maybe they're listening to rap music and hearing the struggle in that and they feel like they need to have some kind of
struggle in their life because everything is taken care of for them you know i have a friend who goes to a university and uh a pretty well-known
liberal university and he told me or she now she she detransitioned he detransitioned back to she and she told
me that half of this school is trans men half the female population of this
particular university is trans what okay i was like wait a minute he said no
there's incentives to come to that school they will help you get your surgeries the actual university
i mean i'm like in shock this is going into the school systems people don't i feel like
a lot of the leftists who really support a lot of the stuff and the kids stuff and all that they very much live in like
2001 right like they are stuck in 2001 where it was very hard to transition that's
right where everyone was very hateful towards trans people and so and they're still caught up in it's like no you have
to understand that in 2022 it's different way different i mean you can literally have your surgery paid for you
can literally go into the clinic and get you know how hard it was for me to get testosterone oh my god you know there
were pharmacists who would not give me my testosterone back in the day and activists pushed against that that's right but they pushed against it so hard
that now you don't even need a diagnosis of anything that's right and it's like but that's just like almost any issue
it's like you take the trans out of it and it's like humans are just so extreme on either end it's like true why can't we just like
we can't just get in the middle and find the truth it has to be like like kids have to go through like hell to get
the drugs or they can never get the it's like yep yeah there's no middle ground there's never a middle ground there's never and also people understand this is
a very personal space it's individual it's personal why are we putting it out all over the world for people to see
this what about these kids who are being transitioned with their parents and being put all over tick-tock and then
they grow up and they're 20 and they're like why did you do that to me mom this is a personal private space now everybody knows i'm trans there are some
kids who don't want to be outed yet they're being outed by their parents their parents are pushing the transition on them i do believe there's some lunch
housing going on here for sure because there's no logical explanation why a parent and then a child would be trans
there's no logical explanation also that it would i mean that's so crazy hereditary
no i can't take it i just you know it's become such a joke the world is like laughing at us right now and it this is
not a laughing space it's a life-saving space and it shouldn't be what it is now it's become a thing it's become a thing
to become i want to be trans i'm like you don't want to be trans you are trans
there's a big difference between wanting something right being something you figure out you're trans you don't become
trans that's right you don't want this label you don't want so that's when i said okay there's a different space going on these kids are identifying as
trans right i identified as a punk rocker because it made me happy and i was like totally rough and i got to hang
out with the dudes and you know what i mean so i see it on some level very very parallel to me trying to find my space
as a youngster yeah let's talk about something a little lighter good luck chasers right on so you
are an adult yeah adult film star yes star like star in the truest definition
because yeah you really started the category of trans male porn you are the most famous trans male porn star on the
planet so we were talking about this earlier it's so interesting i feel like i keep calling back to earlier because the
second he got off the plane we just yeah yeah we don't shut the up and we're together my lady came out of me
[Laughter] very that um but you obviously have done
porn for so long so it's interesting because your demographic is what fans gay men so when i first started game so
i didn't know how i created the very first trans male porn movie in the world like 21 years ago and so i had no idea
what to make right i didn't know who was going to be my demographic of viewers or my fan base none of it because it didn't
exist so i just i actually made three different movies i made a movie with me and all men so it was like kind of a gay movie then i made mine with me
women and men so it was like a bisexual movie and then i made one with me with all women and i just kind of threw them
out there the one with men blew up and all these gay men were like dude i fantasized about a man with a vagina for
my ever i'm like what they literally fantasize about a guy like me and then they would write me all kinds of weird
like you're a weirdo and i'm gonna kill you and you're ruining gay men sex it was so cray all the bottoms were
getting mad
people don't get that like you know there's been studies on the trans women porn and it's all straight men who watch
it that's right like almost exclusively exclusively same thing with the other side which i didn't know that until you told me but
it makes like the most sense in the world yeah that's right yeah i had a best friend for years and unfortunately
we don't talk much anymore we kind of distanced but yeah but he was like my gay best friend for years and he um he
pulled me aside one time he was drunk and he was like can i tell you something i have never told anyone and i'm like sure and he's
like i'm really into trans men and he's a gay male yep that's right and that was kind of the moment where it clicked i
was like oh yeah if straight guys are into me then clearly gay men would be into someone like a black angel or except for
except for it they still they are very much into penis of course they are right but so that's what they had to kind of work
around right so they had to work around this idea and i'm like dude it's just a hole once you kind of just give them
that it's just like oh you're right it's not a big deal and you know gay men be horny is that that's right and they tell them
there's a hole in them dude i have two holes
now you're really in luck dude so it was hilarious and then next thing you know like at first they hated me and
then they just started like if i wouldn't be where i'm at today not only with my pornography but with my work and
being in the world it's gay men who uplifted me and have always uplifted me it's why i fight for gay rights and when
i start seeing our community sort of on some level very homophobic because they are some of the things that come out of
people's mouths are so homophobic it's insane yeah i'm like no no no no no we cannot take over that space that is not
okay like if you don't date a trans person you're transphobic i'm like what what do we say and that's why biology is
important same-sex marriage same-sex partnerships same-sex these are important to people and so we as a trans
community try to take that away we're taking away people's identity choices and that's where i start getting upset
because it's very sex is important to me i think sex is important for everyone i think pornography isn't for everyone but
i think it helps a lot of people it helps a lot it helps me it helps me really become very comfortable with my
body ears you know i'm naked across the whole world and i don't care people either make fun of me or they don't but
i don't have any issues with it at all and i think porn really helps me sort of understand my body being a different kind of body and that's so important
like i think um there's a obviously a really deep fed association of trans people trans women and trans men
um and so i think that and and i like to post like bikini pictures on instagram and i dress a certain way sometimes and
i think people think that i'm much more sexual than i am because they do look like sex pictures but i know they're hot
but i'm actually like i'm not that sexual of a person i have a really low sex drive i um am not as
comfortable with my body as maybe people think that i am because i can put it together for a picture and i can put cute outfits together and then whatever
but yeah i'm not as in tune with my body sexually as i could be so i think it's a beautiful thing when people are and it's
one of those things that um yeah you know i'm really not in line with with um conservatives and right-wing people who
really stigmatize that because i think like that's the one thing they hate yeah and you did a debate with charlie
kirk i did about that and he came after me i knew he was and he was getting all hot and sweaty and i'm just like dude
all hot and what i'm like dude it's okay like it's you know and i was trying to like tell him
look my friend it's it's an elite it's a legal business i pay taxes this is america this is america we can do so so
for somebody who's in your space you shouldn't understand no no it's bad i have a porn addiction i go but that's
not my fault he's literally blaming me for his porn addiction i go my friend addiction is a
very personal space you have to take care of your own addiction that we're not gonna have alcohol
anymore because there's alcoholics out there like that's just the most ridiculous thing so you know i always have to get into these spaces i will always say this
adult entertainment is not for everyone it's called adult entertainment it's not called right anybody can watch sex
there's a reason this thing exists and if we start to understand that it's important for it to be legalized once we
not have it not legal oh my god all hell will break loose we'll have so much bad out there it'll be insane oh yeah i
mean it's the same i mean it's a whole other conversation like kind of a libertarian conversation in the sense of it's the same with other forms of sex
work that's right um which is is porn considered sex work well you know that's the funny thing about porn is legal sex
work isn't so what determines different what determines the difference between people that's right right but then so then you
look at you know i've known um a lot of people in the trans community that are sex workers that's a very common thing
in our community especially trans women yep um and the the crap they go through because everything has to be sort of
under the cover that's right for lack of a better term and and and discrete um they don't have recourse for a lot of
violence they face they don't have a course for stds they may contract that's right um and these clients can really
mess with that really mess with them and run run amok because there's nothing holding them accountable there's they have no legal space i have tons of trans
women friends who are sex workers and it's a very difficult space to be in because you're very vulnerable you can't
just pick up the phone and call the police right that's not going to happen even with porn you can't necessarily do that there's a total stigma around all
of that sex work right so you know yeah it is true there's a lot of trans women who do sex work yeah i think it's
because it's an easier space and it's hard to get jobs and it's hard for trans people to walk in i think
it's harder for trans women than trans men i'll be honest yeah and and it's it's also you know i think i'm actually
the only trans woman i know that has never done sex work oh wow yeah
no i think there's more now yeah yeah yeah for sure but like when i first started transitioning everyone i knew
did it that's right um and and you see the draw of it because you're treated you know maybe as this thing that's like
ugly in society but then you have all these men who were like actually you're beautiful and they'll pay you and so it's this
weird dichotomy and so i see how people get caught up in it i don't judge it at all i think people think that i do
because i never wouldn't be sitting here if you if you judge yeah yeah i would not be sitting here if you judge that i just think life
is crazy in life however you get through life and is is your journey and your whatever that's right and you know if
someone had people sometimes only can afford these surgeries especially in the past when it wasn't covered by surgery by doing sex work and that's their and
that's your story in their journey and and it is what it is you know and it's harder for a trans woman to go get a job a lot of times maybe they're not passing
100 and their id still says male for a person like myself doesn't people don't get so upset about it yeah right if a
butchy girl walks in but she says she's a dude but your license says female people aren't so weird about it they're
much more weird about a man looking like a woman yeah it's a weird it is it's an actual one you know that i can you you
live it i know that it's it's a space that is 100 different and we do need to talk about the difference between being a trans woman and a trans man they're
two different spaces but we were lumped in together a lot with this activism right my needs are different than your
needs my transition is different than yours how i walk the world how just because we're trans we're not the same
we have a total life yeah but it's also um
i do feel a sense of and i don't feel this often with trans people but i do with you i feel a really intense um
camaraderie with you right i feel a bond with you i feel that even though we went in two opposite directions as far as our
bodies um i do feel like there are parallels in the sense that i'm so comfortable around you
and that's just not what i feel about a lot of other trans people neither do i don't have a lot of transfers yeah so i mean this has been really i feel like we
could talk for six hours well we're connected yeah we we we have a lot more work to do oh my god
this is the start this is the start this is the start i think you know like i said i always say i really admire you
and i think you're such a badass and really it's because of you that i'm able to speak out like this so i need you to
know that you really paved the way for other people to come along and say hey wait a minute if if you are brave enough
to stand up against a mob of people then why am i not as powerful and and able to
do that so you did give me this sort of way to you paved it you paid me to be able to sit here and speak out against
the community that i once loved and that i feel very not a part of now yeah well i consider it just giving it back to you
because you paved the way for me you know okay
imagine if i started only fans oh my god i'd be home you buy oh you would make bet you'd be able to buy
